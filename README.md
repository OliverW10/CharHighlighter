# Character Highlighter

Visual studio (not code) VSIX extension to highlight arbratrary characters

Half of it is just the default 'text adornment' [example](https://github.com/microsoft/VSSDK-Extensibility-Samples/tree/master/Options) the second half was copied from the options [example](https://github.com/microsoft/VSSDK-Extensibility-Samples/tree/master/Options) and the third half was some elmers non-toxic wood glue


TODO:
 - Support for multi-unit characters, particularly imporant for utf8
 - Proper list in options page instead of comma seperated
